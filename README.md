# Color-Fade
This program lets you create long strings of hex code using a gui.  
for example FF0000,00FF00,0000FF  
I would put something longer but it would be too long.  
  
To use, press the ADD LAYER button  
Then, press the ADD ALTERNATE button   
Lastly, press the ADD COLOR button  
Finally, a color will appear (default: white) Use the color picker to change it's color.  
  
Any colors inside of an Alternate will alternate back and forth, if you have an Alternate containing Red and Blue, it will show Red, Blue, Red, Blue, and so on.  
Alternates do the same thing, but keeping the alternating in both of them separate  
For example, Alternate 1 containing Red and Blue, and the other containing White will show: Red, White, Blue, White  
This means you can use alternates in combination with them to create patterns of colors easily.  
Layers, you generally won't need more than one of these for the intended purpose but layers are placed on top of eachother, and can be mixed. See below:  
  
All objects have settings, There are also options that let you disable graphical elements, switch between showing what the final output should be or showing what you have selected, as well as  
The setting for colors is what color they are.  
The setting for Alternates is how much the colors fade between (the main purpose of this program)  
The setting for Layers are:  
Setting how far into the previous layer the selected layer will be mixed. As well as choosing whether it is normal mixing or overlaying.  
Increasing the amount of colors in a layer.  
Limiting the max amount of colors in a layer.  
  
Make cool gradients or other sorts of colors!
